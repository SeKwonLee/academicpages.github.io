This paper proposes PMAL (Persistent Memory Adaptation Layer) that allows us to make use of legacy file system for PM while we can leverage the maturity ingrained in legacy file systems and reap the high performance offered by PM. In this work, I verified PMAL consistency mechanism and conducted experimental evaluations.
