title: "WORT: Write Optimal Radix Tree for Persistent Memory Storage Systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/fast17
excerpt: 'This paper proposes radix tree variants, WORT and WOART, that are optimal for PM in the sense that consistency is always guaranteed by a single 8-byte failure atomic write without any additional copies for logging or CoW. In this work, I designed and implemented these PM-based radix tree variants.'

This paper proposes radix tree variants, WORT and WOART, that are optimal for PM in the sense that consistency is always guaranteed by a single 8-byte failure atomic write without any additional copies for logging or CoW. In this work, I designed and implemented these PM-based radix tree variants.
