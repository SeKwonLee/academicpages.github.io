## Description
This project presents a simple yet general method, which we call MeLo@V (Metadata Logging at the VFS layer), for transforming legacy file systems into PM exploiting file systems. In this work, I implemented the variations of PMFS and NOVA for replacing their original consistency mechanisms with MeLo@V.
