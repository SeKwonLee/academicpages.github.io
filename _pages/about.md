### Life inspired by love and guided by knowledge

I am a first year Ph.D. student at The University of Texas at Austin. My research interests primarily lie in storage/file systems, operating systems, database systems and distributed systems. In particular, building a system based on Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) have attracted me because its non-volatility and byte-addressability are expected to bring a new revolutionary progress in computer systems by changing the landscape of various memory and storage systems. If you are interested in working with me or knowing more about me, please feel free to contact me.
