### Life inspired by love and guided by knowledge - Bertrand Russell

I am a first year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. My research advisor is Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/). I am a member of [UT Systems and Storage Lab](https://utsaslab.github.io/) and the [LASR](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/) research group. My research interests primarily lie in storage/file systems, operating systems, database systems and distributed systems. In particular, building a system based on Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) have attracted me because its non-volatility and byte-addressability are expected to bring a new revolutionary progress in computer systems by changing the landscape of various memory and storage systems.

I received my masters in Computer Science from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology), where I worked with Prof. [Sam H. Noh](http://next.unist.ac.kr/professor).
