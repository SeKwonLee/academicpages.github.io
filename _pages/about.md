### Life inspired by love and guided by knowledge - Bertrand Russell

I am a first year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) in the [UT Systems and Storage Lab](https://utsaslab.github.io/) and the [LASR](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/) research group. I received my masters in Computer Science from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology), where I worked with Prof. [Sam H. Noh](http://next.unist.ac.kr/professor).
I am broadly interested in improving the performance and reliability of storage/file systems, operating systems, database systems and distributed systems. Especially, my recent studies focus on designing a new index structures and building a system based on Persistent Memory (PM).
